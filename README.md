# modpy
The purpose of modpy is to provide a comprehensive python package for black-box optimization of problems with computationally expensive function calls (simulations). The underlying approach utilized is a combination of proxy models and experimental designs to achieve maximum information with a minimum number of simulations. The package is designed to handle uncertainty on parameters all along the modelling chain. The philosophy is to navigate in the stochastic domain by characterizing the uncertainty space as opposed to converging towards a single deterministic solution. The cases typically benefiting from such a modelling approach are time-series problems with uncertain initial conditions. These cases often arise in engineering where physical laws are modelled which are stationary in time, but parameterized with uncertain and/or sparse data sets.
